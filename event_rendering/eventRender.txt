eventRender
===========

Triggered while an event is being rendered.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *event*, *element*, *view* ) { }
</div>

`event` is the [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) that is attempting to be rendered.

`element` is a newly created jQuery `<div>` that will be used for rendering.
It has already been populated with the correct time/title.

The `eventRender` callback function can modify `element`, return a brand new
DOM element that will be used for rendering instead, or it can return `false`,
which will prevent the event from being rendered at all.

`eventRender` is a great way to attach other jQuery plugins to event elements,
such as a [qTip](http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/) tooltip effect:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: [
			{
				title: 'My Event',
				start: '2010-01-01',
				description: 'This is a cool event'
			}
			// more events here
		],
		eventRender: function(event, element) {
			element.qtip({
				content: event.description
			});
		}
	});

Note that `description` is a non-standard Event Object field, which is allowed.

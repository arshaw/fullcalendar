eventDrop
=========

Triggered when dragging stops and the event has moved to a *different* day/time.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *event*, *dayDelta*, *minuteDelta*, *allDay*, *revertFunc*, *jsEvent*, *ui*, *view* ) { }
</div>

`event` is an [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) that hold the event's information (date, title, etc).

`dayDelta` holds the number of days the event was moved forward (a positive number) or backwards (a negative number).

`minuteDelta` holds the number of minutes the event was moved forward (a positive number) or backwards (a negative number).
Only useful for the agenda views. In other views, `0` is passed in.

`dayDelta` and `minuteDelta` are elegant for dealing with multi-day and repeating events.
If updating a remote database, just add these values to the start and end times of all events with the given `event.id`.

`allDay` is `true` if the event has been dropped on a day in month view, or the "all-day" slot in the agenda views.
It will be `false` if dropped on a slot in the agenda views (meaning it has been assigned a time).

`revertFunc` is a function that, if called, reverts the event's start/end date to the values before the drag.
This is useful if an ajax call should fail.

`jsEvent` holds the native JavaScript event with low-level information such as
mouse coordinates.

`ui` holds the [jQuery UI object](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/).

`view` holds the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Here is an example demonstrating most of these arguments:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: [
			// events here
		],
		editable: true,
		eventDrop: function(event,dayDelta,minuteDelta,allDay,revertFunc) {
			
			alert(
				event.title + " was moved " +
				dayDelta + " days and " +
				minuteDelta + " minutes."
			);
			
			if (allDay) {
				alert("Event is now all-day");
			}else{
				alert("Event has a time-of-day");
			}
			
			if (!confirm("Are you sure about this change?")) {
				revertFunc();
			}
			
		}
	});

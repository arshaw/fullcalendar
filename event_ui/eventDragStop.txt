eventDragStop
=============

Triggered when event dragging stops.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *event*, *jsEvent*, *ui*, *view* ) { }
</div>

This callback is *guaranteed* to be triggered after the user drags an event,
even if the event doesn't change date/time. It is triggered before the event's
information has been modified (if moved to a new date/time) and before the
[eventDrop]() callback is triggered.

`event` is an [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) that hold the event's information (date, title, etc).

`jsEvent` holds the native JavaScript event with low-level information such as
mouse coordinates.

`ui` holds the [jQuery UI object](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/).

`view` holds the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

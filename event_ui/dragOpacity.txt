dragOpacity *1.3*
=================

The opacity of an event while it is being dragged.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Float/[View Option Hash](../views/View_Option_Hash), *default*:

	{
		// for agendaWeek and agendaDay
		agenda: .5,

		// for all other views
		'': 1.0
	}
</div>

Float values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

Specify a single number to affect all views, or a [View Option Hash](../views/View_Option_Hash) to target specific views
(which is what the default does).

A *View Option Hash* can only be provided in versions 1.4 and later.

Prior to version 1.3, this option was known as *eventDragOpacity*.

Requirements for Event Dragging & Resizing
==========================================

Event dragging and resizing requires the following jQuery UI modules:

- [Draggable](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/) (the Droppable module is **not** required)
- [Resizable](http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/)

These modules can be conveniently bundled/compressed/downloaded at the jQuery UI
[downloads page](http://jqueryui.com/download).
They are also included in the FullCalendar download in "jquery/jquery-ui-custom.js",
all bundled and compressed into one file.

After you have gathered the dependencies, **you still need to enable dragging/resizing**
by settings the [editable]() option to `true`.

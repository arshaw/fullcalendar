eventDataTransform *1.6*
====================

Transforms custom data into a standard [Event Object](Event_Object).

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *eventData* ) {}
</div>

This hook allows you to receive arbitrary event data from a JSON feed or any other
[Event Source](Event_Source_Object) and transform it into the type of data FullCalendar accepts.
This let's you easily accept alternative data formats without having to write a completely custom
[events function](events_function).

This function is called once per received event. `eventData` is the event data that has been
receieved. The function must return a new object in the [Event Object](Event_Object) format.

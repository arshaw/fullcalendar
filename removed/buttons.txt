buttons
=======

<div class='removed-notice' markdown='1'>
This option was removed in 1.3 in favor of [header](../display/header) and [buttonText](../text/buttonText).
</div>

Defines the buttons and button-text at the top of the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean/Object, *default*: `true`
</div>

`true` will display a previous-month, next-month, and "today" button.
The "today" button will only be visible for months other than the current.

`false` will display absolutely no buttons.

An object hash can be provided to display only *certain* buttons.
The hash can have the following properties:

	{
		today:     bool/string,
		prevYear:  bool/string,
		prevMonth: bool/string,
		nextMonth: bool/string,
		nextYear:  bool/string
	}
	
A value of `false` will not display the button. A value of `true` will display the button with some default text.
A string value will display the button *and* customize its text.

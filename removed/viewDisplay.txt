viewDisplay *1.3*
=================

<div class='removed-notice' markdown='1'>
This option has been deprecated in favor of the [viewRender](../display/viewRender) callback.
</div>

Triggered when the calendar loads and every time a different date-range is displayed.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *view* ) { }
</div>

The calendar's date-range changes whenever the user switches to a new view
(for example, if they switch from "month" to "agendaWeek") or when they click the prev/next buttons.

`view` is the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Within the callback function, `this` will be set to the calendar's main element.

Example usage of viewDisplay:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		viewDisplay: function(view) {
			alert('The new title of the view is ' + view.title);
		}
	});

<div class='version-info' markdown='1'>
In versions 1.0 through 1.2.1, this option was known as *monthDisplay*.
</div>

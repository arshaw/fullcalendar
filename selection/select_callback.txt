select *1.4.6*
==============

A callback that will fire after a selection is made.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *startDate*, *endDate*, *allDay*, *jsEvent*, *view* )
</div>

`startDate` is a Date object indicating the beginning of the selection.

`endDate` is a Date object indicating the end of the selection. It follows
the same rules as the [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) for inclusivity/exclusivity:
when `allDay` is `true`, `endDate` *includes* the last day.

`allDay` is a boolean indicating if entire days were selected (days in month view
or the "all-day" slot in the agenda view) or time slots were selected.

`jsEvent` holds the primitive JavaScript event with information such as mouse coordinates.
If `select` has been triggered via the [select method](select_method), `jsEvent` will be `undefined`.

unselectCancel *1.4.6*
======================

A way to specify elements that will ignore the [unselectAuto]() option.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
String, *default*: `''`
</div>

Clicking on elements that match this [jQuery selector](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/) will prevent the
current selection from being cleared (due to the [unselectAuto]() option).

This option is useful if you have a "Create an event" form
that shows up in response to the user making a selection.
When the user clicks on this form, you probably don't want to
the current selection to go away. Thus, you should add a class to your form
such as "my-form", and set the `unselectCancel` option
to `".my-form"`.

viewRender *1.6.3*
==================

Triggered when a new date-range is rendered, or when the [view type](../views/Available_Views)
switches.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( view, element )
</div>

`view` is the [View Object](../views/View_Object) for the new view.

`element` is a jQuery element for the container of the new view.

This callback will get triggered when the user changes the view, or when any of the
[date navigation](../current_date) methods are called.

This callback will trigger after the view has been fully rendered,
but before events have been rendered
(see also: [eventAfterAllRender](../event_rendering/eventAfterAllRender)).

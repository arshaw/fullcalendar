changeView 
=================

Triggered when the calendar loads and every time **before** a different date-range is displayed 
(as opposite to [viewDisplay](viewDisplay) which is called after the the view is changed).

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *view* ) { }
</div>

For more see [viewDisplay](viewDisplay).

`view` is the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Within the callback function, `this` will be set to the calendar's main element.

Example usage of changeView:

  $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		changeView: function(view) {
			alert('The new title of the view is ' + view.title);
		}
	});

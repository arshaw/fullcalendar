weekMode *1.3*
==============

Determines the number of weeks displayed in a month view. Also determines each week's height.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
String, *default*: `'fixed'`
</div>

Available options:

`'fixed'`
:	The calendar will always be 6 weeks tall. The height will always be the same, as determined by
	[height](height), [contentHeight](), or [aspectRatio]().

`'liquid'`
:	The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
	The height of the weeks will stretch to fill the available height, as determined by
	[height](height), [contentHeight](), or [aspectRatio]().

`'variable'`
:	The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
	Each week will have the same constant height, meaning the calendarâ€™s height will change
	month-to-month.

<div class='version-info' markdown='1'>
In versions 1.0 through 1.2.1, this option was known as *fixedWeeks*.

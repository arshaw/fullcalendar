buttonIcons *1.3*
=================

Determines which theme icons appear on the header buttons.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Object, *default:*

	{
		prev: 'circle-triangle-w',
		next: 'circle-triangle-e'
	}
</div>

This option only applies to calendars that have jQuery UI theming enabled with the [theme]() option.

A hash must be supplied that maps button names (from the [header]()) to icon strings.
The icon strings determine the CSS class that will be used on the button. For example, the
string `'circle-triangle-w'` will result in the class `'ui-icon-triangle-w'`.
	
If a button does not have an entry, it falls back to using [buttonText](../text/buttonText).

If you are using a jQuery UI theme and would prefer not to display any icons and would rather
use `buttonText` instead, you can set the `buttonIcons` option to `false`.

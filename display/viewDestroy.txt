viewDestroy *1.6.3*
===================

Triggered when a rendered date-range needs to be torn down.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( view, element )
</div>

`view` is the [View Object](../views/View_Object) for the view that is about to be destroyed.

`element` is a jQuery element for the container of the view.

This callback will be triggered immediately before the view is about to be removed
from the DOM. This could happen because of a [view type](../views/Available_Views)
switch, a date range change, or a [destroy](../display/destroy) method call.
